                                    No. This is a static site, and no data is collected or stored on a server. All data remains in your browser&apos;s local storage.

                                    No. Since data is stored locally in your browser, it is not synced across devices. If you clear your browser storage, your data will be lost.

                                    Data stored in your browser&apos;s local storage is not encrypted by default. If security is a concern, consider using a secure storage extension or clearing local storage periodically.

                                    Yes. You can clear your browser&apos;s local storage or use the reset option in the settings to remove all saved data.
